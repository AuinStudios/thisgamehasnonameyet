### ( i somehow spended like  5 hours just to change alittle bit of the ui and animation god im so terrible at game development  i didnt even did and also added an indicator for cooldown and thats basically it  ugh i hate my self)

### (added animations to the charged attack and stab attack i  redid abit of the  weapon code to sync with the animation and its abit more efficent then it was beforce  and i think the melee system is like 80-70 percent done just need add blocking and maybe make better animations and effects and an indicator for the cooldown)

### (so i came back to the game after a break and now i made a sway system  its not done yet i havent done the rotations but now it moves up and down on the x  and y axis  of the vector whenever u move ur camera it goes to the oppsite direction of where u make ur mouse to and   comes to its location abit fast)
